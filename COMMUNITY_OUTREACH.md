Title: "Open Source SIEM Log Generator with MITRE ATT&CK Integration [Free Tool]"

Hey r/cybersecurity!

I've been working on an open-source log generator specifically designed for cybersecurity professionals. After seeing many posts about the challenges of testing SIEM rules and training SOC analysts with realistic data, I wanted to share this tool with the community.

**What it does:**
üéØ Generates realistic logs from 12+ enterprise sources (firewalls, authentication, databases, etc.)
üõ°Ô∏è Maps logs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques automatically
üîó Simulates multi-stage attack scenarios (APT29, ransomware, insider threats)
‚ö° 238+ logs/minute for performance testing
üß† ML-based pattern learning from historical data

**Perfect for:**
- SOC analysts learning threat detection
- Purple team exercises and red team simulations
- SIEM rule testing and validation
- Cybersecurity education and training
- Compliance testing (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**SIEM Integration:**
Works with Wazuh, Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar, ArcSight - basically any SIEM that accepts JSON, syslog, or CEF formats.
