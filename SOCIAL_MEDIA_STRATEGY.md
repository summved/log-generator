Title: "Free Tool: Generate Realistic SIEM Logs for Security Training [Open Source]"

Body:
Hey r/cybersecurity! 

I wanted to share an open-source tool I've been working on for generating realistic security logs for SIEM testing and SOC training.

**What it does:**
- Generates logs from 12+ enterprise sources (firewalls, authentication, databases, etc.)
- Maps logs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques automatically
- Simulates multi-stage attack scenarios (APT29, ransomware, insider threats)
- Integrates with Wazuh, Splunk, ELK Stack

**Why I built it:**
Testing SIEM rules with realistic data is challenging. Most tools generate obvious synthetic data. This creates logs that mimic real enterprise environments.

**Perfect for:**
- SOC analysts learning threat detection
- Purple team exercises
- SIEM rule testing
- Cybersecurity education

Happy to answer questions or get feedback from the community!

**Discussion Starter**:
```
Title: "What's your biggest challenge with SIEM testing and log analysis?"

Body:
Working on improving our open-source log generator and curious about the community's pain points.

Current challenges I hear about:
- Lack of realistic test data
- Difficulty simulating attack scenarios
- Time-consuming manual log creation
- Limited MITRE ATT&CK integration

What challenges do you face? What features would be most valuable?
